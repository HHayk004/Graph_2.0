Vertex - some object, that hold the information
Edge - show relationship between the 2 Vertexes

V - set of Vertexes
E - set of Edges

There are 2 types of graphs: undirected, directed and weighted
and also: cycled (only for directed graphs)

If graph has loop (vectex has edge to him), we call this graph subgraph

Tree is also a graph
Forest: combination of trees

Graph has at least n - 1 edges

Completed graph: every vertex has edge to every other vertex
            has n * (n - 1) / 2 for undirected and n * (n - 1) for directed

Homework
Implement graph with 2 types of memory: adjusent list and adjusent matrix;
Write dfs iterative (with stack) and recursive
Write bfs (stack change with queue)
